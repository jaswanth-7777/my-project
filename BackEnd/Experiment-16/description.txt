Experiment: Middleware Implementation for Logging and Bearer Token Authentication

In this experiment, I created an Express.js application that demonstrates how middleware functions work in Node.js for request logging 
and authentication. The goal was to understand how middleware processes requests before reaching the final route handlers and 
how to protect routes using a Bearer token.

In the JavaScript,
I used Node.js and Express to build the backend server. Two custom middleware functions were implemented:

Logging Middleware: Logs the HTTP method, URL, and timestamp for every incoming request. This helps monitor server activity and debug requests.
Authentication Middleware: Checks the Authorization header for a Bearer token. Only requests with the correct token (mysecrettoken) 
are allowed to access the protected route. All other requests return an appropriate 401 Unauthorized message.

I created two main routes:
GET /public – A public route accessible without authentication.
GET /protected – A protected route that can only be accessed with the correct Bearer token.

How it works:
The server starts on port 3000 using Express.
When a user makes any request, the logging middleware first records the method, URL, and timestamp.
If the request is for /protected, the authentication middleware checks for the correct Bearer token (mysecrettoken).
If the token is valid, access is granted; otherwise, a 401 Unauthorized response is sent.
The /public route remains open to everyone without requiring authentication.

Overall,
This experiment helped me understand how middleware functions control request flow in an Express.js application. 
I learned how to implement global and route-specific middleware, validate HTTP headers, and secure endpoints using token-based authentication. 
It also improved my understanding of how logging can be used to track request activity and ensure secure access to server routes.
